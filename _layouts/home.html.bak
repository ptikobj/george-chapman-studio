          Transformation lies at the heart of artistic practice. Art is
          related to artifice, in part meaning workmanship, the creation
          of something using craft and skill; in part meaning skill in
          cunning and trickery - the ability to create an impression or
          illusion of something by the process of transformation. Art is
          linked to alchemy, the medieval form of chemistry that dealt
          with the transformation of base materials into gold.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          In his essay on the relationship between painting and alchemy,
          James Elkins breaks down the distinction between the properties
          of materials and their chemical substances:
        </p>
        <p class="f5 pl4 lh-copy measure">
          “The alchemists debated the nature of qualities; sometimes
          they thought of them as clothes that could be taken off,
          leaving the pure ‘body’ of the object, and other times they
          thought qualities were the body itself... the moral I draw
          from these debates... is that where alchemy and painting are
          concerned, there is no reason to distinguish substances,
          qualities, principles, and even elements. What matters in
          any specific instance is what is occupying the mind: a
          certain oil varnish may be engaging because it is unusually
          viscous, in which case a quality counts as a substance...
          substances occupy the mind as concepts and concepts occupy
          the mind as substances.”
          <br>&mdash; ibid. pp 108-109 (emphasis added)
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          In other words, the effects produced by the properties of a
          substance are, in Elkins’ view, inseparable from the substance
          itself and constitute its “body”. While painting is an act of
          transformation, Elkins demonstrates that the point might not be
          to transform the subject into paint; the point may simply be
          transformation itself.

          Nest of Salt presents work by six artists that all deal, in some
          part, with themes of transformation, deconstruction and
          illusion.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          Amanda Houchen studies the relationship between illusionism and
          abstraction through her paintings. Playing with the spatial
          properties of painting using division, colour and light, Houchen
          creates optical illusions in her paintings with the placement of
          flat geometric shapes, fused with more organic forms and
          structures.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          Tim Ralston’s practice deals with deconstructing painting to its
          constituent parts. Focusing on the support and surface of
          painting, Ralston’s frugal approach utilises salvaged and
          reclaimed materials.

          Maggie Williams explores themes of cultural identity and the
          effects of second-generation diaspora. Considering the
          fractured, contradictory experience of belonging, Williams uses
          a wide array of media, from playfully reappropriating found
          objects to challenging the confines of more traditional
          techniques such as embroidery. Her process-based work tries to
          make sense of the liminal space between the two cultures.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          Richard Graville’s practice focuses on cross-species colour
          codes crucial to our survival when life is dangerous. Graville
          has done extensive research into evolutionary biology to
          understand how we share this colour language. Reducing
          unnecessary detail to make us more conscious of how our
          perceptions operate, he builds up his paint surfaces in thin
          coats of Flashe and acrylic paint. Each element of his paintings
          is masked resulting in precise edges and raised zones.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          Stephen Buckeridge looks at painting as a process that is
          constantly being re-negotiated using gestures and marks which
          suggest liminal spaces where traces of activity sit between
          absence and presence or something in-between.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          George Chapman deals with urban spaces that have frequently
          become derelict and imbued with a haunted sense of failure,
          emptiness, and nostalgia. In his paintings, Chapman uses colours
          that are emotive and create a subjective impression of the
          derelict space, as though viewing it from memory or in a dream.
          In this sense, Chapman’s works are about blight and
          disintegration, but also about the fine line between the
          evocative nature of memory and the unsettling feeling that you
          are permanently estranged from home.
