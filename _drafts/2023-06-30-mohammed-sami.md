# Mohammed Sami: The Rub of Time {#title}
30 June 2023

> "When you ignore a long history of conflict, and you paint just a
shadow, the details of history aren't necessary anymore, or not as much
as the effect that lies in the shadow. If people call it traume, I
slightly disagree because it's not about traumatic things — it's more
like a haunting. It's when the memory haunts and changes different
objects."  
> — Mohammed Sami in conversation with Sohrab Mohebbi

The first thing I tend to notice about Mohammed Sami's paintings is the
light. While nearly all of his work relies on the fragile balance
between presence and absence, what is visible and invisible (all of
which contribute to the "haunting" which he discusses with Sohrab
Mohebbi), for me it's the light that creates the haunted, uncanny mood
in each image. Every window, doorway and object is marked by its
proximity to shadow or penumbra, that intermediate stage of an eclipse
where an object or area is only partially obscured. This, more than any
other visual device, emphasises the duality of Sami's work.

For anyone familiar with Sami's work, duality and ambiguity play an outsize role in the paintings exhibited in _The Point 0_, Sami's first institutional solo exhibition, at Camden Art Centre. This is clear from the artwork which lens the exhibition its title: a large, ochre-coloured oval that fills the modest canvas with no clear focal point. The abstract nature of the image jolts the mind into filling the void with something recognisable (a desolate sandstorm viewed from an aeroplane window?), followed by a narrative (is this Iraq; is it an allegory about the war?) But Sami's work is not didactic. He is more interested in ambiguity and suggestion than allegoric symbolism.

While I highly doubt anyone would mistake the shape on the canvas for a yellow egg (an interpretation put forward by the accompanying exhibition text), the inability to firmly grasp the "real" nature of what we're observing is the crucial point (the "point zero") of Sami's work. Every painting in the exhibition deals with a this/that, here/there, visible/invisible dichotomy that is also reflected in the ambiguous title of each work. _Ten Siblings_, for example, objectively depicts a lifesize stack of ten mattresses bathed in a sinister light. The ostensible portrait of siblings only makes sense when considering the absence of any people in the image: the mattresses are a visual metonym for closeness, and one thinks immediately of the corporeal impressions left by each body that once lay on them.

A new iteration of _The Point 0_, featuring four paintings not shown in the Camden Art Centre exhibition, is currently on at De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhil On Sea, East Sussex until 28 August 2023. Visit [De La Warr's website](https://www.dlwp.com/exhibition/mohammed-sami/) for more information.
