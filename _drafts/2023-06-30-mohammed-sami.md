# Mohammed Sami: The Rub of Time {#title}
30 June 2023

> "When you ignore a long history of conflict, and you paint just a
shadow, the details of history aren't necessary anymore, or not as much
as the effect that lies in the shadow. If people call it traume, I
slightly disagree because it's not about traumatic things — it's more
like a haunting. It's when the memory haunts and changes different
objects."  
> — Mohammed Sami in conversation with Sohrab Mohebbi
