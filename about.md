My paintings deal with nostalgia, specifically urban areas that hold a particular significance for me or spaces that are in transition. These transitional spaces evoke feelings of wistfulness: vague ideas of regret or longing, sometimes a longing for home, or even a kind of strangeness when you remember a place as both familiar yet alien. I convey these uncanny memories in my paintings with a mix of abstraction and figuration. I like to think of my compositions as straddling a line between a place that is both evocative because it is recognisable, but unsettling because the place or the memory of it can’t be pinned down.
