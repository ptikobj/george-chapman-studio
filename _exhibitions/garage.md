description: >-
  A garage operates as conduit between an ad hoc and formal
  establishment. It is an informal parking space, a place to store
  clutter and a home for unwanted items. A garage is also a space of
  transition: to disassemble, repair, and renew items that have lost
  their worth. But there can be many representations of a space without
  the space itself. Paintings stand as part of the whole: the ongoing
  project to document the transitional, ephemeral nature of
  Joahnnesburg.
