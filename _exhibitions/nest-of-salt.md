Transformation lies at the heart of artistic practice. Art is related to
artifice, in part meaning workmanship, the creation of something using
craft and skill; in part meaning skill in cunning and trickery – the
ability to create an impression or illusion of something by the process
of transformation. Art is linked to alchemy, the medieval form of
chemistry that dealt with the transformation of base materials into
gold.

In his essay on the relationship between painting and alchemy, James
Elkins breaks down the distinction between the properties of materials
and their chemical substances:

> "The alchemists debated the nature of qualities; sometimes they
  thought of them as clothes that could be taken off, leaving the pure
  'body' of the object, and other times they thought qualities were the
  body itself... the moral I draw from these debates... is that where
  alchemy and painting are concerned, there is no reason to distinguish
  substances, qualities, principles, and even elements. What matters in
  any specific instance is what is occupying the mind: a certain oil
  varnish may be engaging because it is unusually viscous, in which case
  _a quality counts as a substance_... substances occupy the mind as
  concepts and concepts occupy the mind as substances."
> ibid. pp 108-109 (emphasis added)

In other words, the effects produced by the properties of a substance
are, in Elkins' view, inseparable from the substance itself and
constitute its “body”. While painting is an act of transformation,
Elkins demonstrates that the point might not be to transform the subject
into paint; the point may simply be transformation itself.

_Nest of Salt_ presents work by six artists that all deal, in some part,
with themes of transformation, deconstruction and illusion.

Amanda Houchen studies the relationship between illusionism and
abstraction through her paintings. Playing with the spatial properties
of painting using division, colour and light, Houchen creates optical
illusions in her paintings with the placement of flat geometric shapes,
fused with more organic forms and structures.

Tim Ralston's practice deals with deconstructing painting to its
constituent parts. Focusing on the support and surface of painting,
Ralston's frugal approach utilises salvaged and reclaimed materials.

Maggie Williams explores themes of cultural identity and the effects of
second-generation diaspora. Considering the fractured, contradictory
experience of belonging, Williams uses a wide array of media, from
playfully reappropriating found objects to challenging the confines of
more traditional techniques such as embroidery. Her process-based work
tries to make sense of the liminal space between the two cultures.

Richard Graville's practice focuses on cross-species colour codes
crucial to our survival when life is dangerous. Graville has done
extensive research into evolutionary biology to understand how we share
this colour language. Reducing unnecessary detail to make us more
conscious of how our perceptions operate, he builds up his paint
surfaces in thin coats of Flashe and acrylic paint. Each element of his
paintings is masked resulting in precise edges and raised zones.

Stephen Buckeridge looks at painting as a process that is constantly
being re-negotiated using gestures and marks which suggest liminal
spaces where traces of activity sit between absence and presence or
something in-between.

George Chapman deals with urban spaces that have frequently become
derelict and imbued with a haunted sense of failure, emptiness, and
nostalgia. In his paintings, Chapman uses colours that are emotive and
create a subjective impression of the derelict space, as though viewing
it from memory or in a dream. In this sense, Chapman's works are about
blight and disintegration, but also about the fine line between the
evocative nature of memory and the unsettling feeling that you are
permanently estranged from home.
