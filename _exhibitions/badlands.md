> "...when we look at a landscape, we do not see what is there, but
  largely what we think is there. We attribute qualities to a landscape
  which it does not intrinsically possess – savageness, for example, or
  bleakness – and we value it accordingly. We read landscapes, in other
  words, we interpret their forms in the light of our own experience and
  memory, and that of our shared cultural memory."
> — Robert Macfarlane, Mountains of the Mind

> "We walk’d upon the very brink, in a literal sense, of Destruction;
  one Stumble, and both Life and Carcass had been at once destroy’d. The
  sense of all this produc’d different motions in me, viz., a delightful
  Horrour, a terrible Joy, and at the same time, that I was infinitely
  pleas’d, I trembled..."
> — John Dennis, in a letter to a friend about his alpine travels in the
  summer of 1688

Henry Tyrrell, ‘First We Feel Then We Fall’ (2020). Oil and mixed media on linen. 190 x 160 cm. Photo by Jérôme Favre.

Badlands is a group exhibition that deals with themes of chaos,
disorder, transformation, and the sublime in the work of four painters:
Henry Tyrrell, Ollie Guyon, Emily Mary Barnett, and George Chapman. Each
painter touches on their own idea of the sublime in their painting
practice through the instability and unpredictability of painting.
Edmund Burke first articulated the notion of the sublime in 1757 as the
relationship between the feeling of terror associated with the savage
landscape, and the passion that it aroused in our imagination:

“Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain, and danger,
that is to say, whatever is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about
terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a
source of the sublime; that is, it is productive of the strongest
emotion which the mind is capable of feeling.”

These ideas were later taken up by the Romantic painters of the
nineteenth century, who sought out the sublime in nature. Burke was
writing at a time marked by a perspective shift on how bleak and
inhospitable landscapes were viewed. Mountains, along with canyons,
volcanos, deserts, and arctic landscapes, changed from being viewed as
unpleasant or harsh to savagely beautiful environments – places that
challenged classical notions of beauty, and were in themselves
physically challenging for the explorers and walkers who sought out
their beauty first-hand. As Robert Macfarlane phrased it, “Solitude,
deathliness, sterility, barrenness, inhumanity – these were the
qualities of a landscape which Romanticism had made so appealing.”

In contrast to the Romantic view of the sublime, the artists in this
exhibition seek out the sublime in the form and materiality of painting.
The act of painting is a difficult gamble. Given paint’s unpredictable
qualities, the artist is never fully in control of the outcome. Yet the
painter proceeds with their experiment in spite of the odds that they
will fail, to create something that is both savage and beautiful.

Emily Mary Barnett, ‘The Warm Embrace of Decay' (2021). Canvas dust sheet, pigment,
acrylic resin, emulsion, dye. 366 x 274 cm. Photo by Jérôme Favre.

These themes, of the innate disorder in creating something new, of
material transformation, of the search for the sublime in repellent or
inhospitable surfaces, are what we look to question in this exhibition.
Chances are taken and accidents embraced. It is only by accepting the
odds of a chaotic outcome – of inherent instability when pushing the
medium or ground to their material or chemical thresholds – that we
resolve a composition, often with unexpected results.
