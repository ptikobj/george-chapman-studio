  This Must Be the Place is a group exhibition featuring Abigail Harper,
  George Chapman, Ian Grose, Kitty Dorje and Leigh Tuckniss. Having few
  common thematic concerns and no narrative coherence, the exhibition,
  like the song from which it borrows its name, takes the non-sequitur
  as its framework and strategy.
