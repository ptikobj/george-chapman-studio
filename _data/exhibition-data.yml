      Transformation lies at the heart of artistic practice. Art is
      related to artifice, in part meaning workmanship, the creation
      of something using craft and skill; in part meaning skill in
      cunning and trickery - the ability to create an impression or
      illusion of something by the process of transformation. Art is
      linked to alchemy, the medieval form of chemistry that dealt
      with the transformation of base materials into gold.

      In his essay on the relationship between painting and alchemy,
      James Elkins breaks down the distinction between the properties
      of materials and their chemical substances:
    </p>
    <p class="f5 pl4 lh-copy measure">
      “The alchemists debated the nature of qualities; sometimes
      they thought of them as clothes that could be taken off,
      leaving the pure ‘body’ of the object, and other times they
      thought qualities were the body itself... the moral I draw
      from these debates... is that where alchemy and painting are
      concerned, there is no reason to distinguish substances,
      qualities, principles, and even elements. What matters in
      any specific instance is what is occupying the mind: a
      certain oil varnish may be engaging because it is unusually
      viscous, in which case a quality counts as a substance...
      substances occupy the mind as concepts and concepts occupy
      the mind as substances.”
      <br>&mdash; ibid. pp 108-109 (emphasis added)
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      In other words, the effects produced by the properties of a
      substance are, in Elkins’ view, inseparable from the substance
      itself and constitute its “body”. While painting is an act of
      transformation, Elkins demonstrates that the point might not be
      to transform the subject into paint; the point may simply be
      transformation itself.

      Nest of Salt presents work by six artists that all deal, in some
      part, with themes of transformation, deconstruction and
      illusion.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Amanda Houchen studies the relationship between illusionism and
      abstraction through her paintings. Playing with the spatial
      properties of painting using division, colour and light, Houchen
      creates optical illusions in her paintings with the placement of
      flat geometric shapes, fused with more organic forms and
      structures.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Tim Ralston’s practice deals with deconstructing painting to its
      constituent parts. Focusing on the support and surface of
      painting, Ralston’s frugal approach utilises salvaged and
      reclaimed materials.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Maggie Williams explores themes of cultural identity and the
      effects of second-generation diaspora. Considering the
      fractured, contradictory experience of belonging, Williams uses
      a wide array of media, from playfully reappropriating found
      objects to challenging the confines of more traditional
      techniques such as embroidery. Her process-based work tries to
      make sense of the liminal space between the two cultures.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Richard Graville’s practice focuses on cross-species colour
      codes crucial to our survival when life is dangerous. Graville
      has done extensive research into evolutionary biology to
      understand how we share this colour language. Reducing
      unnecessary detail to make us more conscious of how our
      perceptions operate, he builds up his paint surfaces in thin
      coats of Flashe and acrylic paint. Each element of his paintings
      is masked resulting in precise edges and raised zones.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Stephen Buckeridge looks at painting as a process that is
      constantly being re-negotiated using gestures and marks which
      suggest liminal spaces where traces of activity sit between
      absence and presence or something in-between.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      George Chapman deals with urban spaces that have frequently
      become derelict and imbued with a haunted sense of failure,
      emptiness, and nostalgia. In his paintings, Chapman uses colours
      that are emotive and create a subjective impression of the
      derelict space, as though viewing it from memory or in a dream.
      In this sense, Chapman’s works are about blight and
      disintegration, but also about the fine line between the
      evocative nature of memory and the unsettling feeling that you
      are permanently estranged from home.
