# Mohammed Sami: The Rub of Time {#title}
30 June 2023

> "When you ignore a long history of conflict, and you paint just a
shadow, the details of history aren't necessary anymore, or not as much
as the effect that lies in the shadow. If people call it trauma, I
slightly disagree because it's not about traumatic things — it's more
like a haunting. It's when the memory haunts and changes different
objects."  
> — Mohammed Sami in conversation with Sohrab Mohebbi

The first thing I tend to notice about Mohammed Sami's paintings is the
light. While nearly all of his work relies on the fragile balance
between presence and absence, what is visible and invisible (all of
which contribute to the "haunting" which he discusses with Sohrab
Mohebbi), for me it's the light that creates the haunted, uncanny mood
in each image. Every window, doorway and object is marked by its
proximity to shadow or penumbra, that intermediate stage of an eclipse
where the object is only partially obscured. This, more than any
other visual device, emphasises the duality of Sami's work.

For anyone
familiar with Sami's paintings, duality and ambiguity play an outsize role in
_The Point 0_, Sami's first institutional
solo exhibition, at Camden Art Centre. This is clear from the artwork
which lends the exhibition its title: a large, ochre-coloured oval that
fills the modest canvas with no clear focal point. The abstract nature
of the image forces you to try and fill the void with something
recognisable — like a sandstorm viewed from an aeroplane window —
and then a narrative. But Sami's work is not didactic. He is much more interested in ambiguity than allegory.

The inability to firmly grasp the "real" nature of what we're
observing is the crucial point (the "point zero") of Sami's work. Each
painting in the exhibition deals with a here-or-there dichotomy that is reflected in the ambiguous title of each work. _Meditation Room_ (2022) offers a view of a dull room, the light of a semi-open door pouring into view and partly luminating the portrait of a military figure. A scrunched carpet appears trapped under the doorway. We have no other visual clues. But there's an stubborn sense, reinforced by the deceptive title, that what we see is imbued with something sinister and traumatic. The same goes for _The Praying Room_ (2021), where the image of a pair of hands in supplication appears before us even as the face and body are obscured by the shadow of another doorway. The spider-like shadow cast by the houseplant in the foreground further alludes to this dual sense of calm and unease.

In her memoir _In Memory of Memory_, the Russian poet and novelist Maria Stepanova ruminates on her family's collective past, prompted by a cache of
artefacts and personal effects left behind by Stepanova's deceased aunt.
"The subjectivity and selectivity of memory," she writes, "means we can
fix on a historical 'excerpt' which has nothing in common with history
itself..." Stepanova is commenting on the proliferation of digital
images that try to capture every moment as an artefact, or 'excerpt' of
the past, that can definitively seize the past for us. But rather than
preserving the past, the obsessive cult of preservation only reinforces
narratives and ideas about the past which have nothing in common with
what actually took place — a kind of weird nostalgia or veneration for a
past that in reality was neither idyllic nor innocent. (Sami, incidently, doesn't work at all from photographs or other visual source material.)

Possibly one of the more literal depictions of Sami's remembered life is _Refugee Camp_ (2022). Rendered on an
enormous 5.9 metre-wide canvas, the refugee camp is an anonymous
cinder block residence set atop a large scaling rock face. The building
is sensitively and eerily lit by the orange headlights of a car, unseen.
Here, it's the building bathed in an {eerie} orange light that creates
the Hopper-esque sense of unease, {heimweh} and the uncanny. (Sami
mentioned [in an interview with The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/21/mohammed-sami-interview-iraqi-exile-painter-bullets-saddam-hussein) how his memories of his time spent as a refugee in Sweden are among his favourite, and that he returns to the country every month.)

{insert reference to blog post about uncanny light and its relationship to haunting and memory}

The American composer William Basinski demonstrated in his _Disintegration Loops_ series how the attempt to preserve memory inherently alters or destroys it. The idea for the _Disintegration Loops_ compositions came about as Basinski attempted to digitise old cassette recordings of New Age sound loops recorded many years earlier from the radio. The tapes were so old that the magnetic coating literally deteriorated in real time as the tapes were being digitised, capturing the sonic and aural effect of decay. All that remains is the residue, the haunted trace, the knowledge that something _was_ there, but is now permanently absent.

In terms of haunting and absence, nowhere is the absence of figures more palpable than in 
_Ten Siblings_ (2021), which objectively depicts a life-size stack of ten mattresses bathed in a sinister light. The
ostensible portrait of siblings that the title promises only makes sense when considering the
absence of any people in the image: the mattresses are a visual metonym
for closeness, and one thinks immediately of the corporeal impressions
left by each body that once lay on them. Then a follow-up question:
where are those bodies now? It's chilling to make the comparison, but the
abandoned beds carry an unmistakeable echo of the almost unending
inventory of suitcases (not to mention shoes, eyeglasses, prostheses and
orthopedic braces) discovered and preserved at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The
comparison feels even more apt considering the context of the Iraq War
which rendered Sami a refugee in Sweden in 2007 before his resettlement
in the UK.

Similarly, _Father Figure 1_ (2019), which depicts a speckled tiled wall with a mirror reflecting
the identical patterning on the wall opposite. The empty space is
disrupted only by the offside appearance of a houseplant. {Otherwise, we
are entirely alone.} What is eerie about the apparent calm emptiness of
the view is the feeling that someone or something is just out of view.
While mirrors have traditionally been used as symbols for truth and
light in medieval and renaissance painting, Velázquez, van Eyck and
Manet all showed how mirrors can produce a dual reality: what we
perceive versus what actually is, without any clear distinction between
the two. Far from being a symbol of truth and light, Sami uses it to
continue the theme of ambiguity and dual narrative in his work.

The final image in the exhibition, hung just outside the main rooms so you almost miss its modest presence, is _Weeping Wall_. A close-up area of faded patterned wallpaper, bordered by shadows like a vignette, appears odinary enough except for the black spot where a picture nail {appears?} like a bullet hole. It then becomes clear that the light or preserved area of wallpaper is where a picture was once hung, more specifically, the portrait of Saddam that was mandatory in every Iraqi household. Its absence creates a box of light that disintegrates into the shadowed edges of the painting.

There's a saying by the the poet Osip Mandelstam that Stepanova quotes in her memoirs: "Es redt zich azai", or "It is indeed so," but the meaning is the exact opposite: "It is supposed to be so, but I don't believe a word of it." Sami's paintings present us with a version of reality that is tinged with doubt — not at the actual events but at the unreliability of our own ability to recollect. Each painting demonstrates that there is no single authoritative reading; rather, there are layers of truth and layers of conceit. When we mine the past for truth, the only concrete feeling we are left with is its haunting absence.

A new iteration of _The Point 0_, featuring four paintings not shown in the Camden Art Centre exhibition, is currently on at De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhil On Sea, East Sussex until 28 August 2023. Visit [De La Warr's website](https://www.dlwp.com/exhibition/mohammed-sami/) for more information.


sinister -> left handed

"My paintings seek to capture the state of confusion that occurs because
of the cut thread between reality and the imagination; between war
narrated and war witnessed," Sami tells us.
